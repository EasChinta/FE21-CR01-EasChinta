        <h2>About me<br /><br /></h2>
        <p>
          I started taking pictures as a kid with Kodak disposable cameras. The
          stuff I would usually photograph back then, were my dog and cats in
          the garden. <br />
          Later on in high school I worked as an assistant photographer at a few
          weddings. However I truly discovered my passion when I got my first
          camera and started experimenting with all types of photography themes.
          I mostly like capturing interesting angles of buildings as well as
          interesting street photography moments. I do both color and B/W, but
          tend to always like more the B/W versions of my pictures. <br />
          Even though I do not have my own studio yet, I cooperate and even take
          on an event or a personal photoshoot.
