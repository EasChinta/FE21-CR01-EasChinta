Hello and welcome to my first website!

The most difficult part for me was the 'responsive' part. I could not figure out the right way of making my website responsive for any window size or environment (desktop, mobile, etc.). I did however give it my best and works fine for up to some size of the window when minized. I am sure that in the upcoming weeks I will have learned more about this topic. 

On the homepage, you will find also a "Read More" link (only clickable, will not direct anywhere) that I decided to add and style a bit in order to make it look even cooler.

Furthermore, as explained in the comments as well, the main logo on the top right is also linked to the CodeFactory website.

In the Blog part, I was't sure what to add exactly so I decided to go with a funny pic and a link right next to the figcaption, that will actually take you to a wix website I created last year. 

The About me section, does not really contain anything special rather than a h2, paragraph and a picture. 

Last but not least, the Contact section, contains a nice form with name, last name, email and message and a 'submit' button that i wrote on 'try me' instead, which is also linked to a 'thank you' picture. 

I wish you a happy rest of the weekend.
